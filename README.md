# Instagram-Phishing

1. Develop/Implement a well-known cyber-attack:

Phishing is a type of social engineering attack often used to steal user data, including login 
credentials and credit card numbers. It occurs when an attacker, masquerading as a trusted 
entity, dupes a victim into opening an email, instant message, or text message. The recipient is 
then tricked into clicking a malicious link, which can lead to the installation of malware, the 
freezing of the system as part of a ransomware attack or the revealing of sensitive 
information. An attack can have devastating results. For individuals, this includes 
unauthorized purchases, the stealing of funds, or identify theft.


Weaknesses of victim:

Not Training users to detect a phishing email: a sense of urgency and requests for personal data, 
including passwords, embedded links and attachments, are all warning signs. Users must be able to 
identify these warning signs to defend against phishing.

Clicking every links: instead of clicking a link and authenticating into a web page directly from an 
embedded link, type the official domain into a browser and authenticate directly from the manually 
typed site.

Not Using anti-phishing email security: artificial intelligence scans incoming messages, detects 
suspicious messages and quarantines them without allowing phishing messages to reach the recipient’s 
inbox.

Not Changing passwords regularly: users should be forced to change their passwords every 30-45 
days to reduce an attacker’s window of opportunity. Leaving passwords active for too long gives an 
attacker indefinite access to a compromised account.

Not Keeping software and firmware up-to-date: software and firmware developers release updates 
to remediate bugs and security issues. Always install these updates to ensure known vulnerabilities are 
no longer present in your infrastructure.

Not Installing firewalls: firewalls control inbound and outbound traffic. Malware installed from 
phishing silently eavesdrops and sends private data to an attacker, but a firewall blocks malicious 
outgoing requests and logs them for further review.

Clicking on every popups: attackers change the location of the X button on a popup window to trick 
users into opening a malicious site or downloading malware. Popup blockers stop many popups, but 
false negatives are still possible.

Not Being cautious giving out credit card data: unless you know the site is completely trustworthy, 
never give credit card data to a website you don’t recognize. Any site promising gifts or money back 
should be used with caution.


1) The report:

We choose phishing attack as a cyber attack. First of all, we created a fake instagram login
page. Then we sent the link of this fake website to the victims via e-mail and waited for them 
to open the link. Victims who opened the link were directed to the fake instagram page we 
created. When they clicked the Log in button after filling in the relevant inputs, they were 
directed to the real Instagram page without understanding what was happening. In the 
meantime, the information entered by the victims was saved in our .txt file. Thus, we have 
accessed the victims' usernames/e-mails and passwords. Users continued to browse Instagram 
without noticing anything.
The impact of our topic is unauthorized purchases, the stealing of funds, or identify theft.

2) The execution:
